# About
GPX Time Space Diagram is a simple tool for displaying a GPX file in a time Space Diagram (x=time, y=distance). This type of graph is used for traffic signal timing and helps to understand the progression of the traffic signals.


Input: GPX file, Intersection locations (lat,long)

Output: Graph of time-space diagram

Graph output shows a light gray line for the intersection locations and a Travel time calculated from the first intersection to the last intersection.

See example folder for running code and producing a time space diagram.

# Limitations
-Currently setup to plot one direction of travel at a time
-significant manual variable input


# How to Use
Collect a GPX file you would like to plot using a [GPS app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.basicairdata.graziano.gpslogger&hl=en_US&gl=US) or use a [Strava GPX file](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918447-Downloading-a-GPX-route-from-another-athlete-s-activity-Premium-).
